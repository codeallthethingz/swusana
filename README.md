# Swusana

Asana is great but some bits are annoying.  The list view is fixed at 1000px.  There is a lot of noise on the detail page with stories telling you about who moved a task where and these sometimes obsuce the actual human comments.
If you run meetings and take notes into Asana you get added as a follower to every task which then pollutes your inbox with many notifications.

This is a Tamper Monkey script to add buttons to the top nav bar of Asana that let you togle the following functionality: 
- Noise reduction and beautification: hide noise in the comments.
- Auto-unfollow: A blackout period button that auto-unfollows you from all tasks while it is activated.
- Image: Set a custom background image from a URL.
- Timer: Show a counter for a selected ticket (list view only) 

Currently only tested in Chrome.
